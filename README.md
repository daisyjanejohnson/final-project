## Approach to Testing
In this application we are utilizing a testing library called `jest`. We have automated unit and integration tests for the current state of this application.
- `NOTE:` Anything you change / add on this application may or may not break these tests and that is the risk you have to take.
Currently this application is configured to run the following command
```bash
$ npm test
# OR
$ npm watch
```
