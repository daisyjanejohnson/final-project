## Vision

### What is the vision of this product?
A social network for people of all cooking levels to post and share recipes.

### What pain point does this project solve?
This promotes the idea of cooking at home, and being creative, especially during a time where going out to eat isn't the easiest thing to do.

### Why should we care about your product?
It is creating a community for people to interact and build their own collection of recipes, rather than relying solely on internet search.


## Scope

#### IN

- This web app will allow users to post recipes that they have created with other users.
- This web app will allow users to interact with eachother's posts via liking, sharing, and saving to their individual recipe books.
- Users will be able to create and customize their own profiles with their information, and display recipes they have shared with the community.
- Users will have the opportunity to search for recipes to share with others within the website.


#### OUT

- Ths website will never have chat functionality

#### MVP

A user can create an account and login and have a news feed or "lunch line" where they can post and see recipes shared by other users. 

#### Stretch Goals

1. Save Recipes you love to your cookbook.
2. Follow other users to see the recipes they post first
3. Put ingredients you need on a shopping list
4. Find nearby Grocery Stores
5. Use a search engine to search for recipes by ingredients you have or cuisine you like! 


## Functional Requirements

- An admin can create and delete user accounts
- A user can update their profile information
- A user can search all of the products in the inventory


#### Data Flow

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. Security: How is the system and its data protected against attacks? We will have secure login with authorization to keep user's information secure and not allowing others to access their account. We will do this using oAuth.
2. Usability: The technique used in user-centered interaction design to evaluate a product by testing it on users. We want the overall user experience to be simple for the user. We will utilize test-driven development to ensure that all the components we utilize are working the way we want them to, as well as design the UI/UX to be easy to follow for anyone.
